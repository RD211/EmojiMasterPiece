# EmojiMasterPiece
Not the most well written thing in the world but it works.

Using this you can make any photo you give it into an emoji painting either with a genetic algorithm
if you want to minimize emoji use or with a random algorithm.
# Examples
![](/trump.png)
![](/basescu.png)
![](/haha.png)
![](/new.png)
![](/star.png)
